webserver is  a server program  that accepts request from http  clients  and  do process the request and dynamically responds to the client/user.

The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating by an IP network.   TCP PROTOCOL  REPRESNTS TRANSPORT  BETWEEN  NETWORK  AND  RELIABLE COMMUNICATION.AND ORDERED.



application Layer Protocols (DNS, SMTP, POP, FTP, HTTP)
 application layer protocol defines how an application processes (clients and servers) , running on different end systems, pass messages to each other. In particular, an application layer protocol defines:


HTTP: e Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.

HTTP  REPRESENTS APPLICATION  LAYER PROTOCOL.


"WEBSERVER IS  A SERVER PROGRAM THAT ACCEPTS  REQUESTS FROM HTTP (APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL)  
AND  PROCESS THE REQUEST AND  DYNAMICALLY RESPONDS  TO THE CLIENT.

REGARDS  TO FEATURES

LOAD BALANCING :  ?Reduced the work-load on an individual server

to achieve load balancing  use of CLUSTERING :  A GROUP OF SERVERS  WORK TOGETHER AS A SINGLE SYSTEM SERVER
  FOR LOADBALANCING  ( TO REDUCE WORKLOAD).
A cluster is a group of replicated servers. Because there is more than one server, it is possible to load balance requests across them. In addition, a cluster means that the failure of one server does not mean the failure of the system. So, load balancing is just one of the features of a clusteed system, but there are others



Vertical (or linear) clustering is running multiple server instances on the same hardware to better utilize memory or threading and allow for protection against software failure.

Horizontal clustering then is clustering across hardware boundaries for both load balance and failover.


SCALABILITY****:

SCALABILITY IS ARCHITECTURE    PROVIDING  TO ADD  HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE  WITH EXISTING SYSTEM TO MEET  
INCREASE WORKLOADS   AND BY CLUSTERING TYPES  ( VERITCAL  OR HORIZAONTAL).


SCALABILITY:   IS ARCHITECTURE  FOR CHANGING LOAD BALANCING    TO ADD   OR REMOVE OF HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE  .


SCALABILITY IS  AN ARCHITEUS  TO MEET  WORK LOADS   , FOR TO ADD SOFTWARE  AND OR OF HARDWERE   TO MEET WORKLOADS.

A scalable architecture is an architecture that can scale up to meet increased work loads. In other words, if the work load all of a sudden exceeds the capacity of your existing software + hardware combination, you can scale up the system (software + hardware) to meet the increased work load.
